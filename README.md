# Salient Object Detection (SOD) Project

This repository contains an end-to-end **Salient Object Detection (SOD)** system built using a custom **U-Net++ deep-learning model** in TensorFlow/Keras.  
The objective of the project is to generate pixel-level saliency masks that highlight the most important object in an image.

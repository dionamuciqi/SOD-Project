# Salient Object Detection (SOD) Project

This repository contains my **Salient Object Detection (SOD)** project developed using a deep-learning model based on a U-Net++ architecture.  
The goal of the project is to detect the most important object in an image by generating a pixel-level saliency mask.



## What This Project Includes

- **Full Project Report**  
  A detailed PDF document explaining the dataset, preprocessing, model architecture, training setup, evaluation, and results.

- **Presentation Slides**  
  A PowerPoint file summarizing the project in a clear and visual way.

- **Source Code**  
  Python files used for:
  - dataset loading and preprocessing  
  - model architecture  
  - training the model  
  - evaluating and visualizing predictions

##  Summary of the Project

- Dataset used: **ECSSD**  
- Model type: **U-Net++ encoder–decoder**  
- Framework: **TensorFlow/Keras**  
- Output: **Predicted saliency masks**  
- Evaluation metrics: IoU, Precision, Recall, F1 Score  

The model successfully learned to highlight the main object in images and produced consistent visual results.
